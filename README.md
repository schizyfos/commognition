# Commognition
I have created an open cognition tool on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrStYA3bqS4EEUMUvmVgrHZHGvndp2qHP. It's a playlist of Ukrainian IDM songs. I suppose that by listening to it, one can learn something essential, a value core. This is the first step. From there one can proceed into AGI programming.
