I have created an open reflection tool on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrStYA3bqS4EEUMUvmVgrHZHGvndp2qHP. It's a playlist of Ukrainian IDM songs. I suppose that by listening to it one can learn the smallest unit of value and expertize as one proces-concept. A fractal from which and only from which one can proceed with AGI programming.
